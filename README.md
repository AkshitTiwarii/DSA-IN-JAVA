## Unit Testing (To be completed by 26th Jan) (Completed on 31st Jan, off by 5 days)

- Junit is a testing framework used by software developers to test their software.

### Testing Vs Unit Testing
- Testing is done by test engineers, QA's, and testers hired specially for testing
- Unit Testing 
- SDLC-
    - Design
    - Develop
    - Testing

- Steps for testing without Junit
  - prepare
  - provide testing input
  - Run the test
  - Provide Expected Output
  - Perform Assertion
  - Report test results

- Junit 4 and Junit 5
      - Junit 4 uses assert
      - Junit 5 also known as Jupiter API which is the latest version of testing framework.
      - There are many keywords like assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, @Test, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll,@AfterAll,  (Timeout = XX ms) for Junit 4 and for Junit 5 we use Timeout keyword. 


  ## DSA in Java (Starting on 31st Jan)
  - Arrays
  - Linear Search in Array - O(N)
  - Time Complexity - It is the measure of how running time  off algorithm increases with the size of input data
  - Big O Notation 
    - O(1) = Constant Time
    - O(log n) = Logarithmic time
    - O(N) = Linear Search Complexity 
    - O(N^2) = Quadratic Time Complexity
    - O(N log N) = Linearithmic Complexity 
    - O(2^N) = Exponential Complexity
    - O(N!) = Factorial Complexity
